## Buying and Using Bitcoin
## Basics of BTC as how it relates to betting
- If you plan on BTC betting, the basic process is : buy BTC, send BTC to your wallet, sign up for your preferred betting site and get a deposit address, send money from your wallet to the deposit address
- Sending deposits to gambling sites are against the TOS of both Coinbase and Circle. It is always best to send the money to your *private* wallet first and then send to your bookie.

### How and Where do I buy?
- [Coinbase](http://coinbase.com) - Withdraw and deposit BTC directly into your bank. Requires extensive ID verification
- [Circle](http://circle.com) - Withdraw and deposit directly from bank. Allows you to trade $350 per week with no fees attached. Requires extensive ID verification
- [LocalBitcoins](http://localbitcoins.com) - Like ebay for BTC. Trustworthy if you are using a trustworthy seller. You can meet people face-to-face or pay using things like wire transfers. Very good prices from power sellers on here. 
- [MPGH Currency Trade](http://www.mpgh.net/forum/forumdisplay.php?f=885) - The quickest way to get BTC, but often the most costly. Nearly all sellers have built-in fees partially due to the risk they take.

### Turning BTC back into $$
- See [this guide](http://www.coindesk.com/information/sell-bitcoin/) for information. You can also trade with sellers in the currency section.
