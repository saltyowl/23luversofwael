## Buying and Using Bitcoin
### How and Where do I buy?
- [Coinbase](http://coinbase.com) - Withdraw and deposit BTC directly into your bank. Requires extensive ID verification
- [Circle](http://circle.com) - Withdraw and deposit directly from bank. Allows you to trade $350 per week with no fees attached. Requires extensive ID verification
- [LocalBitcoins](http://localbitcoins.com) - Like ebay for BTC. Trustworthy if you are using a trustworthy seller. You can meet people face-to-face or pay using things like wire transfers. Very good prices from power sellers on here. 
- [MPGH Currency Trade](http://www.mpgh.net/forum/forumdisplay.php?f=885) - The quickest way to get BTC, but often the most costly. Nearly all sellers have built-in fees partially due to the risk they take.
