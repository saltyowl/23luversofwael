## Preferred Betting Sites
> All betting sites have a limited number of markets that they support. When I say "best", I mean that they have the largest percentage of the picks that will be posted in our group

- [Nitrogen Sports](https://nitrogensports.eu/r/873216) is best for *esports*
- [Cloudbet](https://www.cloudbet.com/) is best for *soccer and other sports* inside the USA
- [Bet365](http://www.bet365.com/) is best for *soccer and other sports* outside of the USA

You will NOT be able to use only one site if you want to follow esports and regular sports bets. You will have to use nitrogen + your choice of either CB or Bet365. 

## Money Management System
- *One Star* 	★ - high risk
- *Two Star* 	★★-  medium risk
- *Three Star* 	★★★ - least risk

There is no set % as this is gambling and it is up to you what percentage you are willing to risk. A good rule of thumb is 2% / 5% / 7%

## Group Rules
- Do not talk in the picks group. You will notice it has a red "no entry" avatar. Please use the betting predictions chat instead.
- Bets are sometimes shared in the predictions chat. However, these are unoffical bets and often riskier than the ones posted in the "no chat" picks group. Follow them or don't, but don't be upset if they lose. 

### General Betting Advice
- [This guide from Nitrogen Sports](https://nitrogensports.eu/blog/how-to-bet-on-sports/) is a good place to get started

## Buying and Using Bitcoin

### Basics of BTC as how it relates to betting
- If you plan on BTC betting, the basic process is : buy BTC, send BTC to your private wallet, sign up for your preferred betting site and get a deposit address, send money from your wallet to the deposit address. It is normal for the deposit and withdrawal process to take a little while for confirmation
- Sending deposits to gambling sites are against the TOS of both Coinbase and Circle. It is always best to send the money to your *private* wallet first and then send to your bookie.

### How and Where do I buy?
- [Coinbase](http://coinbase.com) - Withdraw and deposit BTC directly into your bank. Requires extensive ID verification
- [Circle](http://circle.com) - Withdraw and deposit directly from bank. Allows you to trade $350 per week with no fees attached. Requires extensive ID verification
- [LocalBitcoins](http://localbitcoins.com) - Like ebay for BTC. Trustworthy if you are using a trustworthy seller. You can meet people face-to-face or pay using things like wire transfers. Very good prices from power sellers on here. 
- [MPGH Currency Trade](http://www.mpgh.net/forum/forumdisplay.php?f=885) - The quickest way to get BTC, but often the most costly. Nearly all sellers have built-in fees partially due to the risk they take.

### Turning BTC back into $$
- See [this guide](http://www.coindesk.com/information/sell-bitcoin/) for information. You can also trade with sellers in the [currency section](http://www.mpgh.net/forum/forumdisplay.php?f=885). 

### Private Wallets?
> Using a private wallet is easy! Install your wallet with the settings you prefer. Once you get a list of deposit addresses, copy one of those addresses and send money to it in order to fill it up. Just use a standard wallet starting out and then you can change if you want more security. 

- [Electrum](https://electrum.org/#home) is a good all-around wallet that offers security but still allows you to recover your BTC in the case of a full system failure. Make sure to write down and keep a copy of your passphrase or you will lose your BTCs FOREVER if something happens to your hardware copy.
- [Multibit](https://multibit.org/) - Technically more secure than Electrum. However, if you lose your wallet, it is lost forever.
